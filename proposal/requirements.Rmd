# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

The core project team will initiate and lead the necessary
consultation, code the proposed package, implement the data model, and
ensure successful outcome of the project. All contributors to the
proposal and people who have been consulted for it (listed below), as
well as other relevant people working on movement, will also be
consulted during the different phases of the work, and will be invited
to contribute further to the realization of the project.

In particular, we request $10,000 in salary for 0.15 FTE of Matt
Boone. Matt is a Data Scientist with a solid experience in R, and will
be the main developer and contributor to the codebase. As all other
contributions will be in-kind, having Matt fully dedicating some of
his time ensures successful completion of the project.


## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

As this project aims ultimately at building a R Movement community, we
will adopt a community-based code of conduct. The recently updated
[code of conduct of rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/)
will serve as a basis, as we share foundational values of openness,
tolerance and inclusiveness.

We will also adopt a "release early, release often" philosophy, where
we publicly provide developments of new ideas and functions. This will
come hand in hand with regular blog posts on the [MabLab
website](https://mablab.org/) to communicate progress, and constant
communication on Twitter by the core team.

Finally, at all stages but especially at the first one ("Use cases"),
we will seek feedback from the Movement community. While working on
the review of R tracking packages, we have been successful in
mobilizing the Movement community through Twitter notably; for
instance, 225 persons filled out our survey on package usage and
documentation. We will use this already established connection to
reach out further, and invite the largest number of people to
contribute and provide feedback. Public development on GitHub will
allow the use of the issue system to initiate and discuss each use
case with and from the community.


## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

No technical constraint is foreseen. All team members are already
equiped with enough computer power to work on the project.
Development will happen publicly on GitHub, and will be open to the
entire movement community. Main hurdles may happen with respect to the
structure of `sf` objects, which will resolved directly with the
consultation and/or collaboration of Edzer Pebesma, author of the `sf`
package.


## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE

-->

We request a total of $10,000 to support 0.15 FTE (7.2 weeks) of Matt
Boone, Data Scientist (Biological Scientist II) in the MabLab at the
University of Florida.

* Salary: $7,369
* Fringe rate (35.70 %): $2,631
* **Total award = $10,000**
