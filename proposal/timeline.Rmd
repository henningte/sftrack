# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

Collaboration platform:

  * GitLab in the lab; synchronized on public [GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/mablab/sftraj) (already available)
  * Code of conduct (from rOpenSci)
  * License: MIT, to allow wide acceptation by other package
    developers

### Use cases

Example of use cases that will be developed during the first stage of
the work:

  * **`trackeR` model**: From the perspective of the `trackeR`
    package, a new object that sets the standards for trajectory data
    should have the following features:
    1. can carry all available movement information that have been
       recorded (time, longitude, latitude, speed, distance,
       altitude);
    2. have methods that allow the user to
      - infer speed from distance and time (and elevation for 3D)
      - infer distance from speed and time (and elevation for 3D)
      - infer distance and speed from time, lon, lat, altitude (and
        elevation for 3D)
      - impute speed/distance from past/future observations if time,
        lon, lat are missing (speeds in humans are extremely
        predictable from past/future speed and I guess the same is
        true for many types of trajectory data)
      - correct altitude data (for 2D)
      - correct coordinate data (by smoothing)
    3. is unit-aware (for speed, distance, altitude) and allows
       changing those units
    4. allows for extra variables (e.g. power, cadence and the likes
       in
    5. the context of athlete trajectories) that are recorded at
       timestamp level
    6. allow for variables that are recorded at trajectory level
       (e.g. athlete name and sport), without having to repeat that
       over all timestamps in a trajectory.


## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

The time frame of this project is over 6 months.  We used the MoSCoW
method to determine what will be delivered from this project, starting
from a minimum viable product to future development:

  * **Must have** (requirements necessary for project completion,
    i.e. the minimum viable product)
    * Use cases defined [month 1]
    * Class(es) definition [month 2]
    * Creators and converters from basic objects (`data.frames`, `sf`,
      `sftraj`) [month 3]
    * Installable package (GitHub) [months 3–6]
    * Accessors and summaries (`print`, `summary`) [month 4]
    * Full function documentation and unit testing [months 4–5]
  * **Should have** (important requirements not necesary for project
    completion):
    * Vignette [month 5]
    * CRAN package [month 6]
  * **Could have** (desirable requirements developed if time allows):
    * Basic plot (static)
  * **Won't have** (requirements that are not planned at this stage):
    * See section on *Future work*.


## Other aspects
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

 - [ ] Announcement post
 - [ ] Delivery blog post
 - [ ] Twitter
 - [ ] UseR!
 - [ ] ISC meetings
-->

We will adopt a "release early, release often" philosophy, where we
publicly provide developments of new ideas and functions. This will
come hand in hand with regular blog posts on the [MabLab
website](https://mablab.org/) to communicate progress (basically for
each deliverable), and constant communication on Twitter by the core
team.
