The movement community in R is at the same time very dynamic and very
fragmented (Joo et al. 2019). Partly, this is because of a lack of a
modern infrastructure to deal with trajectory objects in R. To date,
attempts at creating classes in R are either outdated and relying on
previous generation standards, or too specific to be used in general
cases. We aim to develop a generic and flexible trajectory class based
on `sf`, as a cornerstone for the development of a more cohesive
movement community in R.
