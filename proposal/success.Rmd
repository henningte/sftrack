# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

Publication of a package that is adopted both by users and developers.


## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

During the work: Total contributions (# contributors, # code contributions, #
comments/edits/feedback)

After the work: 
* DL (e.g. using RStudio metrics) → users
* wide use in tracking packages → developers


## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

Future rounds:

  * help for package developers to develop conversion to main existing
    classes (see intro)

  * dynamic visualization (based on rpostgisLT)
  * formalizing a R movement community

  * part of rOpenSci
  * R Journal paper

  * units/errors
  * cleaning/interpolating


## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->

Main risk is absence of adoption by the community (both users and
developers). A very open approach…
