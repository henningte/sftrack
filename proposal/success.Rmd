# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

Publication of a R package that provide usable classes for movement
data, and opens the way to cohesive movement community in R.


## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

Beyond the deliverables listed above, success can be measured both
during and after the work.

During the work:

  * Contributions of the movement community during the early stage
    (use case): number of contributors and contributions
  * Beta testing from the user community: number of testers and issues
    submitted
  * Code contribution: number of contributors and contributions.

After the work: 

  * From a user perspective: number of downloads (e.g. using RStudio
    metrics)
  * From a developer perspective: use in tracking packages.


## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

Future rounds:

  * help for package developers to develop conversion to main existing
    classes (see intro)

  * dynamic visualization (based on `rpostgisLT`)
  * formalizing a R movement community

  * part of rOpenSci
  * R Journal paper

  * units/errors
  * cleaning/interpolating


## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->

Main risk is absence of adoption by the community (both users and
developers). A very open approach from the very beginning will ensure
broad participation of the community, and early adoption and
contribution to the work.
