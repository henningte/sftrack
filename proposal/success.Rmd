# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

Publication of a package that is acclaimed both by users and developers.


## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

During the work: Total contributions (# users, # code contributions, #
comments/edits/feedback)

After the work: 
* DL (e.g. using RStudio metrics) → users
* wide use in tracking packages → developers


## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

Future rounds:

  * conversion to main existing classes
  * units/errors
  * dynamic visualization
  * cleaning/interpolating
  * help for package developers
  * formalizing a R movement community
  * part of rOpenSci
  * R Journal paper


## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

-->

Main risk is absence of adoption by the community (both users and
developers). A very open approach…
